MOCK DEFENSE RECORDING (SOFTDEV)
- the grading is there, but not the test (at yesha's)
- exam is not automated as far the grading is concern
- how would data set of the exam captured
- i thought the idea there to make the exam to standardized to make sure it is uniform (from sir toti)
- if the exam is not automated like the OMR or Moodle, the system of the grading has nothing to do with all
- even if you already have the grades it's still doesn't said na its the same with the other school did.
- if its done manually, they can still cheat
- but if its done digitally, its captured already.
- even tho the teacher who will be the one to input the grades of the student, it still doesn't prove anything in the other school
- solution: OMR or Moodle
- aside from ranking system, it have to provide moodle quarterly exam
- in the electronic data set, i believe your ranking its accurate (from sir toti)
- you will try to prove here is how accurate ranking is
- ranking system is popoulation based
- rank many schools in a district
- historical data must not happen in just
